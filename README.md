# Angular Animated Slide-Down Example

The goal of this project is to try and reproduce, then solve [this issue on StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/45138043/angular-2-animations-failed-to-execute-animate-on-element-partial-keyframe). However, the animation works fine without reproducing the error in the post, so it only serves as an example of how to animate a slide-down reveal with Angular animations :) The example is live [here](http://demo2.robotmonster.ca/).

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
